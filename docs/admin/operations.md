## Restart

Restarting Sextant may be done for several reasons, the most common of which is
to ensure that the helm charts that Sextant uses are the most current according
to its configuration.

1. Go to Sextant web interface.  Click on the control in the top left corner,
   and select `Administration`
1. Click on the `Restart` button
1. Wait for the restart to complete

__NOTE__ that if you try to navigate to connect to or interact with Sextant
while it is restarting you may have difficulty reconnecting or encounter errors
while trying to navigate. These errors will resolve on their own once the
restart is complete.
