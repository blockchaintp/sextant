# Sawtooth Overview

BTP has identified
[Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) as the
best emerging open source blockchain technology on the basis of its support for
smart contracts; its pluggable consensus mechanism; and its scalable, highly
modular architecture - in particular the clear separation between the network
and the application tiers which makes it exceptionally easy for developers to
create new transaction processors leveraging existing code and applying
programming best practices.

## BTP Paralos

In 2020 BTP
[announced](https://medium.com/blockchaintp/btp-delivers-first-long-term-support-lts-release-of-its-hyperledger-sawtooth-distribution-73c7bcf38bf1?sk=bfe418e3f2c10eefcdd170cfe31d03fe)
_BTP Paralos_ - its freely available, enterprise-grade distribution of
Hyperledger Sawtooth. BTP Paralos is 100% open source and is based on
Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1.5 and Sawtooth PBFT 1.0.1. BTP is committed to
contributing any BTP Paralos enhancements or refinements to these upstream
projects.

The code is hosted on Github and freely available, prebuilt Docker images are
published periodically on Docker Hub.
