Sextant automates the deployment and management of enterprise blockchain
infrastructure, and currently supports the open-source Hyperledger Besu and
Hyperledger Sawtooth distributed ledgers.

## Hyperledger Sawtooth

[Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) is one of
the best emerging open source blockchain technology on the basis of its support
for smart contracts; its pluggable consensus mechanism; and its scalable, highly
modular architecture - in particular the clear separation between the network
and the application tiers which makes it exceptionally easy for developers to
create new transaction processors leveraging existing code and applying
programming best practices.

### BTP Paralos

_BTP Paralos_ is a freely available, enterprise-grade distribution of
Hyperledger Sawtooth. BTP Paralos is 100% open source and is based on
Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.1.5 and Sawtooth PBFT 1.0.1. BTP is committed to
contributing any BTP Paralos enhancements or refinements to these upstream
projects.

The code is hosted on Github and freely available, prebuilt Docker images are
published periodically on Docker Hub.
