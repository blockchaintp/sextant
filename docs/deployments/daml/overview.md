# Smart Contracts

Sextant accelerates the adoption of Daml, an open-source smart contract language
and application framework, by simplifying the deployment and management of the
Daml runtime environment on two distributed ledgers, Hyperledger Besu and
Hyperledger Sawtooth, as well as centralized alternatives, Amazon QLDB and
Postgres.
