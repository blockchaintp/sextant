# Deploying Daml on QLDB

-----

__IMPORTANT__ before creating a Daml on QLDB deployment you will need to prepare
your target EKS Cluster by following the instructions
[here](/docs/topics/eks-cluster-aws-services.md).

Note that you only have to do this once and if you have already deployed
Daml on QLDB or Daml on Postgres (with AWS Aurora as the remote Postgres) using
your target cluster then this step will already have been completed.
