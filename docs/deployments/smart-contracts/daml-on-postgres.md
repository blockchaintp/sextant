# Deploying Daml on Postgres

-----

__IMPORTANT__ If you intend to use AWS Aurora then you will need to prepare your
target EKS Cluster by following the instructions
[here](/docs/topics/eks-cluster-aws-services.md).

Note that you only have to do this once and if you have already deployed
Daml on QLDB using your target cluster then this step will already have been
completed.
