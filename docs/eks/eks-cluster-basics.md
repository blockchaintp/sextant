# EKS Cluster Basics

## Create Amazon EKS Cluster

### Step 1

Run the following command to create a 4 node EKS cluster selecting a cluster
name and region name of your choice

```bash
eksctl create cluster \
  --name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
  --region <REGION_NAME> \
  --node-type m5.large \
  --nodes 4
```

* Note that a minimum of 4 nodes is required to support a Sawtooth network using
  the PBFT consensus plugin or a Besu network using IBFT consensue. However
  smaller clusters can be added to such an existing network

* If you choose a region that that doesn't support
  [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  then eksctl will report an error and list the supported regions

### Step 2

Make a brew as this is going to take a few minutes

### Step 3

Once your cluster is ready run the following command to check its configuration

```bash
  kubectl get svc
```

This should return something similar to this

```json
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.100.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   9m45s
```

Now you should be all set to add this cluster to the list of available clusters
in Sextant assuming this is already running. Otherwise you can of course
install and instance of Sextant on it first.

__NOTE__ Sextant only needs to be installed on one of your clusters unless you
are running multiple environments such as development, QA, staging and
production.

-----
_It is important to tear down any resources once you have finished with them
otherwise you will continue to be billed for them_

## Delete Amazon EKS cluster

__WARNING__ Do not delete your EKS cluster if it is running Sextant.

1. Before deleting your EKS cluster, delete any active deployment running on it
   using Sextant

1. Then, delete any provisioned clusters in Sextant

1. Run the following command to delete your EKS cluster specifying the cluster
   name and region name for completeness

```bash
eksctl delete cluster \
  --name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
  --region <REGION_NAME>
```
